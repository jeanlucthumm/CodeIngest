# CodeIngest

> **Note:** Work In Progress

CodeIngest aims to give LLMs deep understanding of the codebase you're working with so you don't have to ever copy paste code again.

Files are watched for changes and automatically ingested into an up-to-date vector database.
This can then be queried directly, or through the provided (easy-to-use) API.
